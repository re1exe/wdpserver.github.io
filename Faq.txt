## How do i make a home?
To make a home you need to **link discord** (see next questions) first!
After you did that
'''/home [name]'''
	Make [name] the name of your home, if you dont fill that in you will get a gui with options.

### How do i link discord?
- Go to the server.
- Type the command '''/discord link'''
- Get the code!
- go to the <#1377998030384660580> channel and fil in the code.
- Now you have access the **Home system** and you recieve **1k of money**

### I cant join!
Check if the server is online by looking at the topic of <#1375876494462681219>.
If its offline wait for 5 minutes and try again!
